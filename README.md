# Baseball_ML

Using XGB Random Forests in order to model and predict daily fantasy baseball. 

This project is in the early works and I'm learning along the process since I haven't dealt with Pandas, Numpy or optimizer libraries for a while. Will look rough for a bit but I'm looking to create a more dynamic approach instead of the scripted approach I'm currently using. 

Attempting to create a whole process to be able to load, model, predict and input lineups to my site of choice.
